# Shallow NNs On UCI
After cloning the repo, reach to the [drive] (https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/my-drive), goto "Shallow NNs On UCI" subdirectory, and copy "data" and "UCI" directories to the current directory.
Then just run one of the sweep files, this will run all 121 tasks, for all 6 models examined in the paper, and will output a latex file.
For example:
```
python3 sweep_seed60.py
```
